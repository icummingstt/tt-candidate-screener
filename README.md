# Developer Screening Instructions

## Overview

Welcome to the React Native Developer Screening Challenge! 

This repository contains a React Native Task Manager app that has **3 intentional bugs** that prevent it from working correctly. Your task is to identify and fix these bugs while demonstrating your React Native, TypeScript, and React development skills.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Fork and Clone
- Fork this repository to your GitHub account
- Clone your forked repository locally:
```bash
git clone <your-forked-repo-url>
cd react-native-task-screener
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### 3. iOS Setup (macOS only)
```bash
cd ios && pod install && cd ..
```

### 4. Run the App
```bash
# For iOS
npm run ios

# For Android  
npm run android

# Start Metro bundler (in separate terminal)
npm start
```

## The Challenge

### What You Need to Do

This Task Manager app should allow users to:
- ✅ View a list of tasks
- ✅ Add new tasks with title and description
- ✅ Mark tasks as complete/incomplete
- ✅ Delete tasks
- ✅ See task statistics (completed vs total)
- ✅ Persist data locally using AsyncStorage

### The Problems

**There are 3 bugs in this codebase that prevent it from working correctly:**

1. **Bug #1 - Performance Issue**: The app has a memory leak that causes performance problems
2. **Bug #2 - State Management Issue**: Adding new tasks doesn't work properly
3. **Bug #3 - Data Persistence Issue**: Tasks aren't being saved correctly to local storage

### Your Mission

1. **Identify** all 3 bugs by running the app and testing its functionality
2. **Fix** each bug using React/React Native best practices
3. **Ensure** the app works correctly after your fixes
4. **Maintain** existing functionality - don't break what already works
5. **Add comments** explaining your fixes (1-2 lines per fix)

## Submission Requirements

### Code Quality Standards
- ✅ Fix all identified bugs
- ✅ Ensure the app runs without crashes
- ✅ Maintain existing functionality
- ✅ Use proper TypeScript typing
- ✅ Follow React/React Native best practices
- ✅ Add brief comments explaining your fixes

### Git Requirements
- ✅ Make logical, focused commits
- ✅ Write clear commit messages
- ✅ Use descriptive branch names (optional but recommended)

### Submission Method

**Repository Fork**
1. Make your changes and commit them to your forked repository
2. Ensure your repository is private
3. Provide the link to your repository

## Evaluation Criteria

Your submission will be evaluated on:

### Bug Fixes (60 points)
- **Bug #1 Fix (20 points)**: Correctly identifying and fixing the performance issue
- **Bug #2 Fix (15 points)**: Properly fixing the state management problem
- **Bug #3 Fix (25 points)**: Resolving the data persistence issue

### Code Quality (25 points)
- Proper TypeScript usage and type safety
- Following React/React Native best practices
- Code organization and readability
- Appropriate use of React hooks

### Git Practices (15 points)
- Clear, descriptive commit messages
- Logical commit structure
- Professional Git workflow

## Time Estimate

This challenge should take no more than **30 minutes** to complete, depending on your experience level.

## Tips for Success

1. **Test thoroughly**: Run the app and try all features to identify the bugs
2. **Read the code**: Understanding the codebase structure will help you locate issues
3. **Use debugging tools**: React Native debugger, console logs, and error messages are your friends
4. **Think about React patterns**: Consider common React anti-patterns and best practices
5. **Check async operations**: Pay attention to how async operations are handled
6. **Test your fixes**: Make sure each fix actually resolves the issue
